Hi Ella!

Wow! Exceptional work. Way beyond what was required, 20/10. Välgodkänt.

I wish I ha some feedback for you - the only thing I could find was a lower case const in loader.js

I really, really think it's great that you go further than what we are covering in the course - eg using localStorage for example. You've not only got an obvious talent for coding, it's clear you also have the passion and drive to get the best out of yourself.

And "no way" on the home button?!? Genius!
